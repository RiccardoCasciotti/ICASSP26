rocm/6.2.2:
   This module is not installed the way it is intended by AMD. Hence some
   parts of ROCm may be broken or offer slower than expected performance and
   there is nothing the LUMI User Support Team can do about that. As the
   module is also not an official HPE Cray module there is no guarantee that
   it will integrate properly with HPE Cray PE modules or work correctly in
   that environment. In fact, it is know to cause problems with the CCE
   compilers prior to cce/18.0.0 due to link incompatibilities. Note that
   hipSolver now requires SuiteSparse, and since that one uses BLAS and
   LAPACK, it depends on the programming environment so is a separate module
   that needs to be loaded if you use hipSolver.
