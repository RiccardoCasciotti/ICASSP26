understand the difference between hard and soft !!!!

ray_search.py : where the parameters are parsed and the main is executed.
    
    run_unsup(): performs unspervised learning and evaluates at the end of every epoch
        train_unsup(): 
            train_hebb(): The criterion can be something like ... ??? criterion seems to be none always, just like measures. 
                            So are they both to be defined??? 


        evaluate_unsup(): 
            evaluate_hebb(): does the unsupervised evaluation ---------------- we can't get in here (return 0.0 error)
                infer_dataset(): 

    run_sup (): runs the supervised learning if the mode is supervised (??? there are instances where the MLP is unsup???)
        train_sup():
            train_sup_hebb(): weigth change vector which is done only the last layer ?????? +  if loss_acc problem
            train_BP():
        evaluate_sup(): 


    run hybrid ()
