### Elastic Weight Consolidation (DeepMind Paper Implementation with Tensorflow.)

This is an implementation of Elastic Weight Consolidation algorithm introduced in [Overcoming catastrophic forgetting in neural networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.00796.pdf). 

Most of the code is sourced from this [repository](https://github.com/ariseff/overcoming-catastrophic), I implemented this purely for learning purposes. I will be pushing more commits to this repository. 

Model used is stored in `model.py` and the experiments are in `main.ipynb`.
